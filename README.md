# MoteinoM0CAM-M8
A [Moteino M0](https://lowpowerlab.com/guide/moteino/moteinom0/) [Breakout board](https://lowpowerlab.com/guide/moteino/m0-sensor-shields/) for a uBlox [CAM-M8Q](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/cam-m8-series) GNSS module.  This module has an integrated GNSS chip antenna.  The board also containers an MCP 1711 Low DropOut regulator to power the module.  The battery backup (V_BCKP) is constantly powered by the Moteino M0 3.3v.

A green LED is connected to the TIMEPULSE output (1 pulse per second, synchronized at rising edge, pulse length 100 ms) as a visual fix indicator.

The LDO Enable pin (to power the main module down), TIMEPULSE and LNA Enable are connected to Moteino pins.

# Setup
* git clone https://github.com/u-blox/CadSoft-Eagle-Library and copy the ubloxLib.lbr to ~/Documents/eagle/libraries so that you have the CAM-M8Q part.

Design Notes
* Search the [CAM-M8 Hardware Integration Manual](https://www.u-blox.com/sites/default/files/CAM-M8-FW3_HardwareIntegrationManual_%28UBX-15030063%29.pdf) for the following referances
** 220R Resitors on RXD and TXD as recommended here; 'To avoid interference by improperly shielded lines, it is recommended to use resistors' and section 2.2 'Minimal Design'
** 4.7uF from Section 2.2 'Minimal Design'
* The Regulator needs to supply 71mA max on CAM-8 startup (see 4.3 Indicative power requirements from the data sheet)
